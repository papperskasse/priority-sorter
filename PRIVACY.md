# 🔒 Privacy Policy - Priority Sorter

## Your Data is 100% Private

**Priority Sorter stores ALL your tasks locally in your browser. We never send, collect, or store any of your data on our servers.**

## What This Means

### ✅ What We DO
- Store your tasks in your browser's localStorage
- Allow you to export your tasks as files
- Let you import previously exported tasks

### ❌ What We DON'T Do
- Send your tasks to any server
- Collect any personal information
- Track your usage
- Share data with third parties
- Use cookies for tracking
- Require user accounts or authentication

## How Your Data is Stored

Your tasks are stored using your browser's **localStorage** feature:
- **Location**: Only on your device, in your browser
- **Access**: Only you can access it (on that specific browser)
- **Persistence**: Data remains until you clear your browser data or delete it
- **Privacy**: Completely private - never transmitted over the internet

## Data Export & Import

### Export
- When you click "Export JSON" or "Export CSV", we create a file on YOUR device
- No data is sent to any server during export
- The file is saved directly to your downloads folder

### Import
- When you import a file, it's read entirely in your browser
- No data is sent to any server during import
- The file remains on your device

## Browser Data

Your tasks are stored in your browser's localStorage under the key: `priority-sorter-tasks`

### To View Your Data:
1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to "Application" or "Storage" tab
3. Click "Local Storage"

## Multi-Device Sync

**Priority Sorter does NOT sync across devices** because everything is stored locally.

If you want your tasks on multiple devices:
1. Export your tasks from Device 1 (creates a file)
2. Transfer the file to Device 2 (email, USB, cloud drive, etc.)
3. Import the file on Device 2
